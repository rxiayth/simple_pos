App.js
    - the main container of the whole system.

    - has 'menu' : the product name, sku, price, etc
    - has 'inventory' : the volume of each sku

    - 3 components
        1. Menu.js
        2. Cart.js
        3. Actions.js

    - has callback functions
        1. selectMenuItem - send to menu
            - called when user clicks on one of the items on the menu
            - take in sku, output nothing
            - update cart to include the selected item
        //2. selectCartItem - send to cart
        //    - called when user clicks on one of the items on the cart
        //    - take in sku, output nothing
        3. selectAction - send to actions
            - called when user clicks on one of the items on the actions

            - discuss how the layout should look like.
                - 4 funcs in app, send all via prop to actions to each action?
                    - messy
                - 1 func in app split by a parameter (1,2,3,4) send one via prop
                    to actions, action sends to each action with parameter 1234?
                    - unnecessary information in each action
